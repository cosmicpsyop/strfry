strfry (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Prevent exporting a v2 DB using --fried. The packed representation
    will be     corrupted. Instead, you should downgrade to 0.9.7 to do
    the export, or do     it without fried.
  * Fix build error on some platforms that don't include stdint.h in
    another     header. Reported by fiatjaf.
